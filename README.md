# ESP32 7-Segment Display Interface

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates interfacing a **common anode 7-segment display** with an ESP32 microcontroller. The system continuously displays digits from **0 to 9** using GPIO control logic.
It is a basic embedded systems project that helps in understanding digital output control, segment mapping, and hardware interfacing.

## Features
- Displays digits from 0 to 9 continuously
- Uses ESP32 GPIO pins for segment control
- Demonstrates common anode display logic
- Simple and efficient embedded code
- Beginner-friendly hardware project

## Components Used
- ESP32 Development Board
- 7-Segment Display (Common Anode)
- Resistors (220Ω)
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires

## Working Principle
1. Each segment (a–g) of the display is connected to ESP32 GPIO pins.
2. Since it is a **common anode display**, the common pin is connected to VCC.
3. Segments are activated by sending **LOW signals** from ESP32.
4. The program cycles through predefined patterns to display digits 0–9.
5. A delay is added between digits for visibility.

## Technologies Used
- Arduino IDE / ESP32 Arduino Core
- Embedded C/C++
- GPIO Programming
